# Pizza Sales Analysis (6-Week SQL Learning Project)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete SQL-driven analysis of a fictional pizza store’s sales data. It was developed as part of a **6-week weekly task series** focused on growing practical SQL and data analytics skills. 

Using raw transactional data on pizzas, customers, and orders, the project explores trends in sales, revenue, customer behavior, and product performance — all aimed at answering real business questions.

## Dataset Overview

The project uses four core tables:

| Table Name      | Description                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `orders`        | Contains order ID, date, and time.                  |
| `order_details` | Tracks which pizzas were bought in each order.     |
| `pizzas`        | Contains pizza ID, size, and price.                 |
| `pizza_types`   | Contains names, categories, and ingredients.        |

## Project Objectives

- Understand order trends across days, weeks, and months.
- Identify best-selling pizzas by quantity and revenue.
- Analyze performance across pizza categories and sizes.
- Investigate sales and order peaks by time of day.
- Track revenue growth and top contributing products.
- Practice SQL skills by writing optimized, real-world queries.

## Key Insights & Questions Explored

- What are the top 5 best-selling pizzas?
- Which category brings in the most revenue?
- How does sales volume change across months?
- What time of day has the highest number of orders?
- Which pizza size generates the most profit?

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (SQL Server syntax used)

---

## Learning Outcome

This project helped solidify foundational SQL concepts including:
- Joins, CTEs, aggregation, window functions
- Time-based analysis using `DATE_TRUNC`, `EXTRACT`, etc.
- Grouping, sorting, and filtering for insights
- Translating business questions into efficient SQL queries

Each week tackled a new focus area, building skills step-by-step.
